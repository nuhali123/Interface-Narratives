# Interface-Narratives

# [Project name]
Our project is a audio experience created on spotify which focuses on telling various stories through conversations about Pakistani culture and Personal experiences.

# Theme  

Our chosen theme is Pakistani cultural experiences on individual scales. We will be doing this by subverting the interface of Spotify - which is used mainly for listening to music and podcasts. Each song/podcast will be a recorded conversation of a phone-call, showcasing the communication systems pakistanis have to connect to their culture across the world or in Pakistan. These personal stories will be referencing stereotypes of the culture which refernce tradition and will feel familiar to any pakistani.

# Mechanics  

the Mechanics of our project will be audio based a user will experience being a third-party of a phone-call converstaion, something that is usually intimate and closed-off, especially considering the aspect of a niche community and culture.

# Aims  

Our objectives are to educated and inform people about Pakistani Culture through this mordern way of communication through traditional styles of conversations. This is to reflect that although Pakistan and pakistanis have modernised, cultural and taditional values and tendencies are still core to the collective identity. 

# Aesthetics/Technology 

Our project is gonna be designed to showcase various stories this will be done using the spotify's podcast creation function where each episode is a new story with its own unique name and thumbnail which we will use archive or online images to set a scene for the story. Our stories will be recorded in our native language which will either be in 'Urdu' or 'Punjabi'. if the interface allows usage of subtitles we will translate into english for non Pakistanis to listen.


# Group  
Aliza & Nuh Ali - our project will be around 8 minutes so we will do one story for every minute and we both will divid the workload by half meaning we both will source and record four stories individually. We both will find archive or online images for our Thumbnails.
